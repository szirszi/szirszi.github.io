            <p>In the last years, I was a teacher and a part time system administrator. Earlier (arund 2001) for 3 years I wanted to
                be an IT professional with self-education, but I returned to teaching.</p>
            <p>But now I decided to start a new career, and I'm ready to become a full time developer with the aid of
                the Green Fox Academy.</p>
